### [0. Strace is your friend](./0-strace_is_your_friend.pp)

Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).

Hint:

strace can attach to a current running process
You can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another one
